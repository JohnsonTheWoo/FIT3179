GDP and life expectancy generally show a positive correlation, with wealthier nations often having longer life expectancies due to better healthcare and living conditions. However, many factors beyond GDP, such as healthcare access and lifestyle choices, also influence life expectancy. It's a complex interplay of economic, social, and healthcare factors. </p></div>
